Testing
Alex's unit test:
-   Tests both the JobProgress and JobHours functions, along with a very basic test of ensuring that job creation takes place and amount of pieces is correct. 
-   To run this test, go to the 'java/test/ProgressAndHoursTest', right click on it and press run 'ProgressAndHoursTest'.

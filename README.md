Testing

Basic Test File: testServer.sh <br />
To Run: Type ./testServer.sh in a shell (works on akka/ukko) <br /> 
This test file runs shell scripts that issue curl requests <br />
Scripts will test and display:
1) Dashboard Requests
2) GET requests (/getAllJobs, /)
3) POST requests (/addJob, and later /updateJob)
=======
## Reminder: Server that application converses with is at 'http://131.212.41.37:3316'

Note: This is currently running on a local machine, not akka or ukko (Will put on akka or ukko next time we meet... Probably tomorrow if all goes well)

/addJob, /updateJob, and /importantInfo are now working

Also began trying to format the Manager Dashboard, now everything is alphebatized and I don't know why, but it certainly shouldn't be.

No work has been done on trying to get information back from the server yet, but I found a nice website that gave me an idea as to how we could do it..
